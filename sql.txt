SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity 
FROM Products AS pr
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS ordts
ON pr.ProductID = ordts.ProductID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName) AS Employee_Name, ProductID, Quantity 
FROM OrderDetails as ordts
INNER JOIN Orders AS ord 
ON ordts.OrderID = ord.OrderID
INNER JOIN Employees as emp 
ON ord.EmployeeID = emp.EmployeeID;
